.. note::

  Estimated time to complete: **90 MINUTES**

Nutanix Era is a software suite that automates and simplifies database administration – bringing one-click simplicity and invisible operations to database provisioning and lifecycle management (LCM).
With one-click database provisioning and Copy Data Management (CDM) as its first services, Nutanix Era enables DBAs to provision, clone, refresh, and backup their databases to any point in time.
The rich and straightforward UI and CLI enable DBAs to clone their environments to the latest application-consistent transaction.
The API-first Nutanix Era architecture can easily integrate with your preferred self-service tools.
Every operation has a unique ID and is fully visible for auditing.
